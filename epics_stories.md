## Themes, Epics, & Stories
An idea in the formulating stage.
These are taken from various blogs / articles and videos I stumbled across.

### Themes
- are an organisation level goal / initiative, usually aligning to a company strategy
- are usually a single word or phrase
..."Personalisation", "User Adoption", "Scalability"
- contain broad information for wide consumption
- are achieved by completing one or more Epics, across one or more teams

### Epics
- outline a value add which aligns to a theme : new user journey, user problem to solve
- written with a user focus and goal : “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”
..."As a seller on Trade Me, I want to be able to sell books using ISQBN numbers, so that I can list them faster"
- achieved by completing one or more stories
- have flexible scope. As the team learns more about an epic through development and customer feedback, user stories will be added and removed as necessary.
- are (almost always) delivered over a set of sprints.
- can be put on a roadmap / short term plan

### Stories
- can be delivered within a sprint
- a goal which works towards an epic
- is expressed from the software user’s perspective: “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”
...[Example]
- something about MVP

### Tasks
- all the things that need to be done in order to deliver a story
