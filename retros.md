### Retrospective
#### The 3 Ls: Liked – Learned – Lacked
http://www.funretrospectives.com/the-3-ls-liked-learned-lacked/

Split the canvas in 3 areas:
- Liked – things you really liked
- Learned – things you have learned
- Lacked – things you have missed
    
#### KALM – Keep, Add, More, Less
- Keep – something the team is doing well and you recognize the value on it.
- Less – something already being done; but you rather do less of it.
- More – something already being done; and you believe will bring more value if done even more.
- Add – a new idea, or something you have seen working before that you would like to bring to the table.

#### Speed Car
http://www.funretrospectives.com/speed-car/
– Engine: What have been pushing us forward? Making us move faster?
– Parachute: What have been slowing us down?

#### Dinner plate
- Fish fillet - Hard work, but fulfilling
- Potatos - Easy to do, and was fulfilling
- Brussel sprouts - Good for us, but maybe didn't taste so good
- Desert - What we really wanted

#### Score 4x4
Four aspects : Productive, Skilled, Happy, Outlook
- Give each area a score out of ten. 1 being miserable, 2 being ok, 4 being amazing. You can use a broader (0-10) scale if you want to draw out more detail / variation.

Divide the canvas in to four, with an aspect in each one.
- Productive: How productive are you feeling?
- Skilled: How well are we using your skills?
- Happiness: How happy are you feeling?
- Outlook: What's your outlook for the future?
Address one aspect at a time. The team take turns putting their score against an aspect. 

Identify any things which the team could change to improve the score (by you, us, anything)
Go around each aspect.

The actions go on the team scrum/kanban board and get looked at mid sprint, and at the next retro - Have we done/started doing any of these?

#### Good/Bad/Try
or "Smile, Sigh, Experiment to try", "Positives, Poisons & Potential"

What has made you happy, what has made you less than happy, what should we try out?

Divide the canvas in to three, with an aspect in each: Smiley face, Sad Face, and Experiment beaker work well
- Get the team to add at least one thing, and a max of three things (there top three).
- Dot vote on the "things to try" and pick the top two to pull in to the next sprint. Put them on the team scrum/kanban board and get looked at mid sprint, and at the next retro - Have we done/started doing any of these?

### Intro-spection
Forces teams to look at their own actions/impacts
Good when you find your retros are constantly "this team affected us". Encourages teams to take control.
Each person has to have an answer for: What's one thing...
I am proud of?
I wish had I had done better?
I want from the team?
I can do for others?

### Project level
#### Peaks & Valleys
http://www.funretrospectives.com/the-peaks-and-valleys-timeline/
Futurespective
Draw a timeline
Mark any key dates, milestones or events - people leaving, product shipping, pivots
Get team members to draw a line representing either happiness, productivity, or something else
"Starting on the beginning of the timeline, and keeping the marker on the canvas the whole time. Please share your Peaks and Valley timeline. You should do so by drawing the line and speaking at the same time."
