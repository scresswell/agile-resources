This is a good exercise for a new team or a team that needs to visualise their skills.

It's a safe exercise, allowing people to share as much or as little about what skills, interests and aspirations they have.

##Setup

Create a collaborative context; explain that the whole team are going to participate into a special market place. 

In this market place the team member presents

* the skills they can contribute to the team
* the skills outside their role which may be useful
* the skills they want to develop (eg. during the project)

It is important to emphasize to the team that this is an appreciative exercise. 

##Make a poster

Divide an A3 paper in to thirds.

In each third, answer the following questions:

* Skills in my role (That they can contribute to the team / project)
* Other skills I have (That may be outside their role, but which may be useful or relevant to the team / project)
* Skills I'd like to lear (Skills they want to develop - may not be during the project)

##Present your poster (5 min per poster)

Each person presents their poster. 

##Reflect

For the skills we want to develop

* are their people in the team who can help develop those skills??
* who outside the team might be able to help develop those skills?

Are there any skills we are missing for this project?

Are there any 'other skills' which suprised you?
