# Team Health Surveys

## Preamble
Team Health Surveys are short. snappy, fortnightly surveys to track the health of our squads, and focus actions on any areas of concern.
The stakeholders are team members, squads, their Delivery & Product Managers and People Leads
A team’s results are shared back to the team (anonymised), with the team having the option (but no obligation) to deep dive.
The collective info can feed into a public dashboard (once you have some data) showing trends and hot spots.
The survey itself is 9 questions covering 3 areas: People, Product, Process

## IRL
* The team takes the survey before their retro / fortnightly
* The results are shared back, with the team having the option (but no obligation) to deep dive.
* People Leads are responsible for reviewing the team’s responses and own any escalation/deep dive actions.
* Any actions/outcomes from the survey should be documented and fed back to the team, so they know their responses are listened to.

## The Survey
Answers are “Score each question with  1 Completely Disagree to 5 Completely Agree”
Individuals’ answers are only visible to the development managers - anything presented to other people is anonymized.
Questions are designed to be repeatable, so we can monitor trend over time
### People - thinking about your squad
* We respect each other and feel safe communicating openly 
* We work as a team and collaborate often
* I have fun
### Product - thinking about the work your squad is doing
* I have enough customer context on what I'm working on
* I understand the customer problem I'm working on
* I understand how my work fits into the bigger picture (our product vision and strategy)
### Process - thinking about how your squad works
* We have a clear understanding of our goals, roles and execution plans
* We deliver high-quality results on time
* We are continually improving how we work
