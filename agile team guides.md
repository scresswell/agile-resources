# Guides in Agile Scrum / Kan Ban teams

## Definition of Ready
+ Goal : prevent problems before they have a chance to start.
+ control what product backlog items can enter an iteration.
+ enables a team to specify certain pre-conditions that must be fulfilled before a story is allowed into an iteration.
+ can be dangerous, push teams towards sequential / stage-gate approach.
### Examples
+ [I.N.V.E.S.T](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/)
  + *I* : Inedpendent.
    Self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another team or story.
    Prevents those dependencies from derailing a story or an entire iteration if the other team fails to deliver as promised.
    Forces us to identify and plan for any dependencies.
  + *N* : Negotiable
    Details of scope are flexible and team may propose various solutions to achieve the goal of the story.
  + *V* : Valuable.
    There is an identifiable value add which will be delivered by completing this work.
    We continuously deliver valuable software.
  + *E* : Estimable
    Has detailed acceptance criteria, including a lo-fi prototype where there is a UX impact.
  + *S* : Small
    Cannot sensibly be broken into smaller parts, and feels like it is achievable within two weeks.
  + *T* : Testable
    Can be tested without having to wait for subsequent stories to be delivered.
More specifically.
+ User story described.
  _“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”_
+ Acceptance criteria written.
+ Tasked - we know which tasks need to be done to achieve the Story.
+ Sized with tasks and relative complexity in mind.
+ Impacts on existing components, teams or projects have been identified and communicated.
+ Prioritised by the Product Owner.


## Definition of Done
### Examples
+ Code / implementation peer reviewed.
+ Test activities completed and reviewed.
  + developer tests implemented (unit, integration, performance tests).
  + walk-through.
  + test approach documented.
  + automation tests created, reviewed.
+ Acceptance criteria met.
+ Deployed to a production / appropriate environment.
  + Rollback plan created.
+ Demo'd to Product Owner / stakeholder / customer.
+ Activities to measure / report on success started.
+ Documentation / knowledge sharing completed.
+ Tech debt tasks raised.

## Ways of Working
### Examples
+ Developers don't test their own stories / code.
+ All code is peer reviewed.
+ Communication.
  + Standups.
    Report on yesterdays wins and fails.
    Outline the plan for today.
    Update on any blockers / upcoming leave / areas you need help.
  + We take technical conversations out of stand up.
  + We huddle during a sprint if we need when discussing changes to scope, or implementation.
+ We swarm on stories to get them delivered.
  + We are experts in our field and the tasks associated with them (dev/test/etc), but that doesn't mean we're the only one who can complete tasks in that space.
  + We ask for help and make ourselves available to help.
+ We operate a warranty period, expediting bugs in stories delivered last sprint.
+ Meetings
  + No meeting without an agenda / goal.
  + Attend and be present. Laptops closed, focus on the goal.
  + Make attendance easy and expected for people working from home.
