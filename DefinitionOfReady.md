# Guides in Agile Scrum / Kan Ban teams

## Definition of Ready
+ Goal : Stories are fleshed out enough before we commit to delivering them.
+ Enables a team to specify certain pre-conditions that must be fulfilled before a story is allowed into an iteration.
  + can be dangerous, push teams towards sequential / stage-gate approach.

### Examples
+ [I.N.V.E.S.T](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/)
  + *I* : Inedpendent.
    - Self-contained, in a way that there is no inherent dependency on another team or story.
    - Prevents those dependencies from derailing a story or an entire iteration if the other team fails to deliver as promised.
    - Forces us to identify and plan for any dependencies.
  + *N* : Negotiable
    - Details of scope are flexible and team may propose various solutions to achieve the goal of the story.
  + *V* : Valuable.
    - There is an identifiable value add which will be delivered by completing this work.
    - We continuously deliver valuable software.
  + *E* : Estimable
    - Has detailed acceptance criteria, including a lo-fi prototype where there is a UX impact.
  + *S* : Small
    - Cannot sensibly be broken into smaller parts, and feels like it is achievable within two weeks.
  + *T* : Testable
    - Can be tested without having to wait for subsequent stories to be delivered.
+ User story described.
  _“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”_
+ Prioritised by the Product Owner.
+ Acceptance criteria written.
+ Tasked - we know which tasks need to be done to achieve the Story.
+ Sized with tasks and relative complexity in mind.
+ Impacts on existing components, teams or projects have been identified and communicated.
+ Success criteria defined and metric gathering discussed.
