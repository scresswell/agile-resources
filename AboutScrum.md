Understanding Scrum
Scrum is the most popular framework among Agile teams; 58% of respondents to VersionOne's 11th Annual State of Agile Report use pure Scrum. A further 10% are using a Scrum/XP hybrid.

Background

The first mention of Scrum in the context of product development was in The New New Product Development Game-Takeuchi, Hirotaka, and Ikujiro Nonaka, Harvard Business Review 64, no. 1 (January–February 1986).

In the paper, the two professors describe efforts by companies to try to speed up their product development life cycles to decrease their time to market. They observed that companies that were successfully doing this were employing some interesting alternative approaches.

These companies were assembling small teams of highly capable people with the right skills, setting the vision for them to build the next-generation product, giving them a budget and timeframe, and then getting out of the team's way to let it do its thing.

Some observed characteristics of these teams included having all the skills necessary to carry out the job they were being asked to do—the essence of a cross-functional team. They were allowed to determine how they best carried out the work, so were self-organizing and autonomous. They used rapid, iterative development cycles to build and validate ideas.

Nonaka and Takeuchi called it the rugby approach because they observed product teams passing the product back and forth among themselves as it was being developed, much like a rugby team passes the ball when moving upfield. In a rugby game, the team moves as a unit and even though each team member has a specialty regarding position on the field and gameplay, any member of the rugby team can pick up the ball, carry it forward, and score a try or goal. The same was true of these product development teams—their contribution to the product development was specialist and highly collaborative.

In the section of their paper titled Moving the Scrum downfield, they list the common characteristics of the teams they observed as follows:
* Built-in instability: Some aspect of pressure was introduced, which encouraged the product development teams to think out-of-the-box and use an innovative approach to solving the problem.
* Self-organizing project teams: The teams were given the autonomy to decide how they carried out the task of solving the problem handed to them.
* Overlapping development phases: Instead of the normal sequential-phased development that you get with processes such as Waterfall, the teams worked iteratively, building quickly and evolving their product, with each iteration. Multiple phases overlapped, such that the following steps might be informed by the discoveries made in the previous one. In this way, the teams were able to gain fast feedback about what would and wouldn't work.
* Multilearning: A trial-and-error learning culture is fostered, which allows team members to narrow down options as quickly as possible. They are also encouraged to diversify their skill sets, to create team versatility. Nonaka and Takeuchi called this multi-learning because they said it supported learning along two dimensions: traversing different layers of the organization (individual, team, unit, and group) and across various functions. This cross-pollination of skills is an aspect of cross-functionality we encourage today.
* Subtle control: The approach to managing these projects was very different. To create a space for the team to innovate, they realized command-and-control supervision wouldn't work. Instead, management would check in with the team regularly to check progress and give feedback, leaving the team to manage its work how it saw fit.
* Organizational transfer of learning: If and when the development life cycle began to move towards mass manufacture, the product development team would often be strategically placed in the wider organization to seed knowledge and assist with the preparation for production.

The approach described by Nonaka and Takeuchi has similarities to the Skunk Works projects started in World War II by Lockheed’s Advanced Development Programs division.
The Skunk Works team were originally tasked with designing and building a highly secret prototype jet fighter aircraft around a new jet engine developed by a British company, deHavilland. The work commenced on little more than a handshake, and the team was formed in a location separate from the rest of the group and given relatively free rein on how to proceed. They were given 150 days to complete their prototype; they finished it in 143.
Skunk Works was an official alias that originated with the Lockheed special projects development team during World War II. Due to a lack of room at its California premises, the team worked out of a well-guarded Circus Tent next to a manufacturing plant from which strange smells wafted in. The team associated the odor with a famous comic strip of the time called Li'l Abner, in which a mysterious moonshine factory deep in the woods brewed a terrible smelling concoction. The moonshine factory in the comic strip was called Skonk Works; over time this evolved into Skunk Works.
Lockheed's Skunk Works took on many secret projects after the war finished. Their approach gained notoriety among other companies, including Apple who built the Macintosh in a Skunk Works type operation behind a restaurant in Cupertino. It also seems to have permeated through to the product development teams that Nonaka and Takeuchi were observing when they wrote their paper.
Everett Rogers (in Diffusion of Innovations, 4th Edition) points to the reason for isolating a project team and allowing them to take this crash approach to product development: it's because companies operate as bureaucracies. The stability and continuity that a bureaucratic organization seeks are at odds with the instability needed to foster innovation. Most find it undesirable to disrupt their own, currently successful, business model. The Skunk Works approach fosters maximum creativity by isolating the teams away from the organizational mainstream, allowing them to innovate around both their process and product.
Some of these ideas would go on to influence Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber when they started working on the Scrum framework in the early 1990s. In 1995, they formalized and presented it as a paper at the Business Object Design and Implementation Workshop held as part of OOPSLA’95 (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, Programming, and Applications) in Austin, Texas. In the following section we'll introduce Scrum and talk through the basics with an overview of its characteristics, roles and events.

## Introduction to the mechanics of Scrum
Here are the basic characteristics and features of Scrum:
* Planning style: Empirical/adaptive
* Delivery style: Iterative/incremental
* Iteration length: Ranges between 1 and 4 weeks; a length within this range is initially chosen by the team and then fixed. The most popular is 2 weeks.
* Values: Commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect
* Roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team
* Team size: small, 5-9
* Artefacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Sprint progress tracking
* Events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective
* Special features: All events are time-boxed
* Lacks: A product/project/feature initiation phase and doesn't specify technical practices

### Roles
There are three roles in Scrum: the Product Owner, the Scrum Master, and the Development Team.

Team size is essential in a Scrum.
Face-to-face communication is preferred by Agile teams; it's open and has a high bandwidth. The larger the team gets, the harder it becomes for each team member to know everything that is going on.
Scrum recommends a team of no fewer than five and no more than nine. Fewer than five (which includes the Product Owner and Scrum Master) and it's believed that the team will be limited in what it will be able to achieve. More than nine and the team's communications will become strained, and information may fall through the cracks.

### Artifacts
The Scrum Guide defines three artifacts—Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment
Scrum uses an incremental approach to delivering. It achieves this by working in iterations known as Sprints. The recommended length for a Sprint is between a minimum of 1 week to a maximum of 4 weeks. Most teams opt for a 2-week Sprint:
The Sprint isn't the only aspect of Scrum that has a time limit, also known as time-box. All of events, such as Sprint Planning, the Daily Scrum, and so on, are also time-boxed. The aim of time-boxing an event is to ensure focus is maintained. The time-box for each event is proportional to the length of the Sprint and is set out in the Scrum guidelines.

## Sprint Planning
### Part 1
The Sprint starts with Sprint Planning, a meeting where the whole team comes together. The aim of the first part of Sprint Planning is for the Development Team to forecast which items, from the top of the already prioritized Product Backlog, they think they can achieve in the coming Sprint.
Several factors influence their decision including the following:
- The latest product increment.
- The items in the Product Backlog.
- The team capacity for the upcoming Sprint; for example, are any members on leave?
- How did the team perform in the last Sprint?
- Are there any work items being carried over from the last Sprint?

The usual process will involve the Development Team taking the next story from the top of the Product Backlog and discussing whether they think they can complete it as part of the coming Sprint. Usually, this begins with one of the team reading the story aloud, including the acceptance criteria. The Product Owner should be available for questions if the Development Team needs any clarifications. If, after discussion, our team believe they can complete it in the coming Sprint, they put it on the Sprint Backlog. They then take the next story from the Product Backlog and repeat the process.

Once the Development Team has determined the items from the Product Backlog they think they can achieve, the Scrum team as a whole works to set the Sprint Goal.

### Part 2
The second part of Sprint Planning is for the Development Team to determine how they will do the work. Deciding how involves discussion and breaking down the work into tasks, for each Product Backlog item in the Sprint. At the end of the Sprint Planning Meeting, the resulting set of of work items, including the Sprint Goal is collectively known as the Sprint Backlog.
Once ready, the Sprint Backlog is added to the team's Scrum Board. For Scrum teams, this usually takes the form of physical board, such as a whiteboard or similar, and would look something like as follows:

## The Daily Scrum
Once the Sprint is in progress, the Scrum team meets each day to coordinate their work. This meeting is called the Daily Scrum.
The Scrum team will congregate around the Scrum Board and discuss what they've achieved since they last met, what they will be working on until they next meet, and whether there are any problems, or if there is anything in their way.
The Development Team will update the board as necessary, moving tasks from left to right as applicable. This Scrum Board’s primary function is to help the team to coordinate their work, ascertain progress, and quickly uncover any assumptions or identify any risks in their plan. The team should remain focused on meeting the Sprint Goal; as such, this is a key inspect-and-adapt meeting for the team.
The meeting is timeboxed to 15 minutes to keep it purposeful and focused. Although the Scrum Guide doesn't indicate this should be a standing meeting, many Scrum teams will stand for their Daily Scrum. This is something that's been adopted from the Extreme Programming community. The aim of making it a standing meeting is to keep it short; people are less inclined to talk at length if they're standing.

## The Sprint Review
The Sprint Review is the first meeting held at the end of the Sprint cycle. The attendees include the Scrum team and stakeholders for the product. The working software for each completed User Story is demonstrated to the group. The Sprint Review aims to inspect and adapt the business value delivered by this latest increment, to see if we can optimize it further. Based on the feedback gained, the Product Owner can then adjust the backlog (adapt the plan) accordingly.

## The Sprint Retrospective
The Sprint Retrospective usually follows on immediately from the Sprint Review and is the last meeting of the iteration. It's an opportunity for the Scrum team to inspect and adapt its process. In general, the Scrum team will ask itself what went well during the Sprint, what didn't go well, and what it can improve. They should consider aspects such as the team dynamics as well as processes and tools. The outcome of this meeting is for the team to come up with actionable improvements that it can carry out during the next Sprint.

## Additional events
Most Scrum teams add additional events to their Scrum workflow. A good example is called backlog refinement, an event which some teams hold as regularly as once per week, or at least once per Sprint.

The backlog refinement meeting aims to look at the top stories on the backlog and prepare them to be worked on in an upcoming Sprint. Part of this preparation will include estimating the User Stories, which will tell us whether:

1. We have enough information to able to start working on the User Story
2. We've broken the story down into a small enough chunk; a User Story must be small enough to be completed in one Sprint

Estimates are usually given in Story Points.

## Additional Artefacts
Definition of Ready - tells us the quality control steps we usually go through to ensure a work item is ready to worked on by the team.
Definition of Done - tells us the quality control steps we usually take from the point we start working on an item, to the point it’s delivered into our customer’s hands.
