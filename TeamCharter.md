A team charter covers several aspects of how our team will carry out its work:

It's a process definition and agreement about how we will accomplish our work

It's the social contract defining how we will interact with each other, and how we will work together as a team

Remember, the team charter is a living document; it will evolve as our team evolves its practices. It should be posted somewhere in our team's area so that we can reference it and annotate it as we go.

The following steps take us through the necessary activities to form an initial team charter.


Step 1 – Defining done
Step 2 – Working agreement
Step 3 – Team calendar

Step 1 – Defining done


The Definition of Done (DoD) is the agreement we use to define how we will know when our work is complete. It looks like a checklist. On it are the tasks that we need to carry out for us to deliver a new feature, enhancement, or bug-fix as part of the next increment of working software.



As a team, we are responsible for defining done. 

What you'll need: Post-it notes, Sharpies, a spare wall or whiteboard Remember: Set a time box before we start

Ask the team to think of the steps they go through from the point where they are given a requirement, to the point where they deliver it in the form of working software.
Work collaboratively, write down each step on a post-it note, and share as you go.
Put each step onto the whiteboard or wall in a timeline from the left (start) to the right (finish).
Ask the team should consider the quality aspects of what they are delivering, as well as the steps they will take to avoid mistakes and make sure the delivery pipeline runs smoothly.
Once the timeline is complete, discuss it as a group. If our group is happy and there's no more to add, for now, write out the timeline as a checklist.
It's useful to remind ourselves that done means more than just "coding done" or "testing done" or "review done." To do this, we talk about "done done." "Done done" is when we know that absolutely everything that is needed to take this increment to a production-ready state is completed.

Step 2 – Working agreement
Next, we look at our social contract; this defines ground-rules for working together as a team.

What you'll need: Post-it notes, Sharpies, a spare wall or whiteboard Remember: Set a time box before we start

Set up the whiteboard with the banner WORKING AGREEMENT and the subtext WE WORK BEST TOGETHER WHEN


Distribute post-its and sharpies to each team member.
Explain to the team that they are going to use silent brainstorming to complete the phrase WE WORK BEST TOGETHER WHEN... 
Each idea for finishing that sentence should be written on a post-it note, one idea per post-it only, and as many post-its/ideas as they like. They can use the example topics for inspiration if they need to.

Agree on a time box with the team for silent brainstorming and writing post-it notes, somewhere between 5 to 15 minutes.
Then set the timer and start the activity.

Once we have finished coming up with ideas, or the time-box is complete (whichever comes first), we take it in turns to go up to the whiteboard and place our post-it notes on it.
We should do this one post-it at a time, reading them out loud to the rest of the team as we go.

Once each team member has placed their post-its on the board, we should gather around the board as a group.
The aim of this stage is to group similar ideas or remove any duplicates.

The final step is to review the revised working agreement and decide if we can all abide by it.
Are there any changes? Anything we should add?

Step 3 – Team calendar
Forming a consensus amongst the group about the days/times that we meet will help ensure everyone can attend and we don't miss out on anyone's contribution.
Cadence is an essential part of Scrum or Kanban. Establishing a rhythm is key to the success of the incremental delivery approach. The regular iteration cycles give the team a heartbeat by which it operates.



Ask our team to layout their Sprint calendar

What day is good for starting our Sprint?
Explain that it will be easier to first determine the Sprint start and end dates then set up all meetings. For example, Sprint Planning happens on the first day of the Sprint. Sprint Review and Retrospective are on the last day of the Sprint. The DAILY SCRUM should be every day, at a time agreed on by the team, except when it clashes with the Sprint Planning or Sprint Review or Sprint Retro meetings.
What time suits people for Daily Scrum (stand-ups)?
When do people arrive in the office? What morning rituals should we be considerate of?
Are their days we don't do Daily Scrum (stand-ups)? 
For example, on the first day of the Sprint, a team may choose to hold the Daily Scrum after Sprint Planning. Sometimes teams hold their Daily Scrum directly after Sprint Planning; sometimes they don't feel it's necessary. We should use our discretion.
The same thinking applies to the last day of the Sprint; for example, if we decide to hold both the Sprint Review and Sprint Retrospective events in the afternoon, perhaps we should have a Daily Scrum to coordinate our work in the morning.
Who do we need to invite (required and optional) to each meeting invite


Once the team has reached an agreement, schedule all meetings at given time slots for the foreseeable future.
