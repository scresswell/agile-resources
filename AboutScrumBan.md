Scrumban = Scrum + Kanban

Use the prescriptive nature of Scrum to be Agile.
Use the process improvement of Kanban to allow the team to continually improve its process.
With the Kanban’s pull system in place, our flow will become smoother as our process capability improves. We can use our inter-process buffers and flow diagrams to show us our process weaknesses and opportunities for kaizen. As we get closer to level production, we will start to become less concerned with burndown and more concerned with cycle time, as one is the effect and the other is the cause. Average lead time and cycle time will become the primary focus of performance. If cycle time is under control and the team capacity is balanced against demand, then lead time will also be under control. If cycle time is under control, then burndowns are predictable and uninteresting.

Since the team now pulls work into a small, ready queue before pulling it into WIP, the team’s perspective of the iteration backlog’s utility is that it always contains something that is worth doing next. Therefore, we should use the least wasteful mechanism that will satisfy that simple condition.

Kanban iteration backlog

A simple mechanism that fits the bill is a size limit for the iteration backlog. Rather than going through the trouble of estimating a scope of work for every iteration, just make the backlog a fixed size that will occasionally run to zero before the planning interval ends. That’s a simple calculation.

In Scrumban, we can do iteration planning at regular intervals, synchronized with review and retrospective, but the goal of planning is to fill the slots available – not fill all of the slots, and certainly not determine the number of slots. This greatly reduces the overhead and ceremony of iteration planning. Time spent batch-processing for iteration planning estimation can be replaced with a quality control inspection at the time that work is promoted to the ready queue. If a work item is ill-formed, then it gets bounced and repeat offenders get a root cause analysis.

Advantages
Quality
Just-in-time (decisions and facts just when they are needed)
Short lead time
Kaizen (continuous improvement)
Minimizing waste (everything that is not adding value to the customer)
Process improvement by adding some values of Scrum as and when needed
When to consider Scrumban
Maintenance projects
Event-driven work
Help desk/support
Hardening/packaging phases
Projects with frequent and unexpected user stories or programming errors
Sprint teams focused on new product development
Work preceding sprint development (backlog, R&D)
Work following sprint development (system testing, packaging, and deployment)
If Scrum is challenged by workflow issues, resources and processes
To manage improvement communities during/after Scrum roll-out
Scrumban Backlog
Avoid creating/analyzing too many stories (requirements/defects) – reduce waste
Assure the necessary level of analysis before starting development
The backlog should be event-driven with an order point
Prioritization-on-demand – the ideal work planning process should always provide the team with best thing to work on next, no more and no less

Summary
Kanban is compatible with Scrum, the project management method. Adding WIP and visualization to Scrum, i.e. Scrumban, helps improve Sprint Commitment effectiveness. However, it is also introduces the WIP limit as a mechanism to catalyze incremental changes. The WIP limit obviates the need for commitment to drive change, reduces any dysfunctional reliance on heroic effort, and improves overall systems thinking when considering potential improvements. It looks somewhat like Scrum at the practice level, but at the cultural level it will look like Kanban – soft evolution rather than shock treatment and revolution.
