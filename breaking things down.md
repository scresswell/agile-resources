## Themes, Epics, & Stories
An idea in the formulating stage.
These are taken from various blogs / articles and videos I stumbled across.

### Themes (Outcomes)
- directly align to a company strategy.
- are an organisation level desired outcome.
- contain a VCARDI.
- contain broad information for wide consumption.
- are able to be summarised in a single phrase.
  - _"Improve site performance"_
- are achieved by completing one or more Epics, across one or more teams.

### Epics
- a chunk of work that has one common objective aligning to a theme.
- can be put on a roadmap / short term plan.
- contain enough detail about the value add in order to be prioritised against other Epics.
- should be defined as an MVT or MVE, so that we can prioritise / scope stories
- have flexible scope.
  As the team learns more about an Epic through development and customer feedback, Stories will be added and removed as necessary.
- may not contain all the details in the beginning that team needs to start work. These details are defined in Stories as the Epic is refined.
- are written with a user focus and goal : “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”
  - _"As a seller on Trade Me, I want to be able to sell books using ISQBN numbers, so that I can list them faster"_
- has identified personas / users
- are (almost always) delivered over a set of sprints.
- Rule of thumb; if there are more than 5 stories, of same focus area, then it’s good to create an Epic and attach all five of those user stories to that Epic.

### Stories
- are a goal which adds value towards an Epic.
- are expressed from the software user’s perspective: “As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”
  - _"As a Seller on Trade Me, I want the sell process to be populated with data from ISBN, so that I don't have to enter the information"_
- [I.N.V.E.S.T](https://xp123.com/articles/invest-in-good-stories-and-smart-tasks/)
- can be delivered within a sprint.
- are prioritised with other stories in their Epic, focussing on the MVP or MVT for that Epic.

### Tasks
- all the things that need to be done in order to deliver a story.
