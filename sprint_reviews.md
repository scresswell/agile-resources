## Purpose
- Demonstrate the delivered items from the previous sprint.
- Solicit feedback from stakeholders on the delivered items.
- Solicit opinions from stakeholders on the upcoming backlog items.

"The sprint review is a venue to solicit feedback and opinions from stakeholders. It is an opportunity to develop a relationship with stakeholders, provide transparency, and build trust.  We are focused on work and meeting as people. The sprint review is not the venue to make decisions about what will be in the next sprint.  Opinions on the upcoming backlog may be taken forward to inform sprint planning."

## Agenda
The sprint review should take place immediately after the end of the sprint and before the sprint planning for the next sprint.  It should not be the same meeting as the sprint retro (which is held with squad members and no stakeholders).

## Who should attend:
All stakeholders to whom the delivered items are relevant, or who will have relevant opinions on them, or who will have opinions on the future backlog.

## Format
- Welcome (Squad rep) - introduce new people and those who will be presenting
- Outline the ground rules and expectations
- Provide an overview of the previous Sprint Backlog to show what will be demonstrated (and what wonâ€™t be): User story; status; Demo (Y/N)
- Demonstrate the delivered items (Squad members)
- Brief overview of any events and problems in the sprint (Squad rep)
- Discuss and solicit opinions on upcoming backlog items (Product Manager)
- Praise, gratitude, delicious donuts (Product Manager)

## Outcomes
- Collate the feedback, comments and questions from stakeholders
- Take the opinions on the Product Backlog forward to inform sprint planning
