## Ways of Working Examples
### Examples
+ We focus on the goals at hand.
  + When we aren't available, our team knows.
+ We pride ourselves in deliverying value and quality for users and ourselves.
  + We operate a warranty period, expediting bugs in stories delivered last sprint.
+ Communication.
  + Standups.
    + Talk to the board
    + Report on yesterdays wins and fails.
    + Outline the plan for today.
    + Update on any blockers / upcoming leave / areas you need help.
  + We take technical conversations out of stand up.
  + We huddle during a sprint if we need when discussing changes to scope, or implementation.
+ All work is peer reviewed (code, tests, acceptance criteria, measures etc).
  + We don't test our own stories / code.
+ We swarm on stories to get them delivered.
  + We are experts in our field and the tasks associated with them (dev/test/etc), but that doesn't mean we're the only one who can complete tasks in that space.
  + We ask for help and make ourselves available to help.
+ Meetings
  + No meeting without an agenda / goal.
  + Attend and be present. Laptops closed, focus on the goal.
  + Make attendance easy and expected for people working from home.
+ We celebrate achievement.
+ We reflect on the way we work regularly, and make changes to rapidly and continually improve
